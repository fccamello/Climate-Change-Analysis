## 📖 Project Overview

The notebook focuses on:
- 📊 **Data Analysis** — cleaning, processing, and visualizing climate-related datasets
- 🌲 **Tree Cover Loss** - examining deforestation trends and their contribution to carbon emissions
- 🌊 **Sea Level Rise** - analyzing how global sea levels are changing due to melting ice sheets
- 🏭 **Greenhouse gas Emissions** — analyzing emissions data to identify correlations with climate patterns  
- 🌡 **Temperature Trends** — studying global and regional temperature changes over time  
- 🧊 **Ice Extent** — investigating the decline in Arctic and Antarctic ice coverage  
- 📈 **Visualizations** — creating charts and plots to highlight key findings

## 📊 Key Insights

- 🏭 Greenhouse gas emissions are a major cause of rising temperatures, increasing sea levels, and the shrinking of ice coverage.
- 🌊 Sea level rise is strongly connected to greenhouse gas emissions and tree cover loss, indicating that both deforestation and emissions contribute to rising oceans.
- 🌲 Tree cover loss contributes to increasing greenhouse gas emissions and rising temperatures, further intensifying the effects of climate change.
- 🌡 Rising temperatures are linked to greenhouse gas emissions and lead to a reduction in ice extent, reinforcing the impact of global warming on polar regions.
- 🧊 Ice extent decreases as sea levels rise
